## Overview

Welcome to **Grim Repor** — an AI-powered framework designed to **resurrect dead dependencies**. We identify research papers with code using our vigilante that roams the internet that finds broken or outdated Python dependencies and **fixes them** so your code runs smoothly again.

**You are here because we found your broken repository.**  
Give us a new repo, and we’ll put it’s back in action. We are dedicated to keeping great research projects alive, allowing researchers to focus on **what matters most**: innovation.

## What We Do

1. **Scan & Identify**: Our AI scans repositories, identifying broken or outdated dependencies.
2. **Fix & Upgrade**: We automatically fix version mismatches, upgrade dead dependencies, and ensure compatibility with modern environments.
3. **Deliver Working Code**: Once the fixes are in place, we provide a working version of your repository — so you and your users can focus on research, not debugging.



## Our methodology in detail
Most of the workflow below occurs in `scripts/build_check.py`.

- Run thru the repos we have available. 
    - Presently: These are in `scripts/paper_repo_info.csv`
    - Future improvement: we will source this more dynamically
- For each available repos assess what they use for dependency resolution to produce a list of packages that must be installed via `pip`:
    - Presently: `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml` (conda), and `setup.py`  based repos are supported. Other systems result in a "No requirements found" message
    - Future improvement: Expand to support other depedency/build systems (Docker, etc.)
    - Future improvement: Actually pull the GitHub repo (currently we just fetch the dependency file)
- Attempt to install required packages:
    - Presently: Create a new venv in a temp directory based on the `requirements.txt`. If pip is able to install all the required packages we call this a "Success"
- On install failure:
    - Attempt to fix using techniques (`scripts/process_errors.py`):
        - Check the date of the last commit and assume that the project built/ran then. Set dependency versions to the latest release at that point in time (findable via pypi's `Release History` page (ex: https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#history))
        - Check for duplicate entries for a given dependency
        - Check for mis-spelling of common
    - Attempt to a re-install
- Attempt to build:
    - Presently: Some projects may require an actual build step (vs being purely interpreted). At present none of this is considered.
- Verify functionality 
    - Presently: Does not appear to happen at all
- Store results of the workflow (that is subsequently used by other files)
    - Presently: Results are stored in `output/build_check_results.csv`
    - Future: Something more robust like a SQLite DB


`output/build_check_results.csv` is used as an input to:
- `scripts/new_repo.py`.
    - TODO: This script seems to not do much. Clones repos, but doesn't do any actual checks...
- `scripts/process_errors.py`
    - This implements the fixes.
    - Seems like it needs some work around Forking, pushing, creating a PR.

## Setup

### Create and activate a virtual environment:

Create virtual environment
```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
```

Activate virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install required packages:
```bash
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run python script(s)
```bash
(venv) python3 scripts/build_check.py
```

To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:
```bash
(venv) deactivate
```
